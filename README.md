# Draggable Window
Make any panel / window in your Godot Engine UI draggable. Made in Godot Engine 3.2.1

Bear in mind you might have to recreate the scene on your own and provide a valid path to the drag_panel.gd script. Also, the texture button in the scene is using a 15x15 px texture with color #ff0000 with modified versions for hover and pressed textures, which is not included here.

You are free to use / modify however you want, without the need to mention me.
